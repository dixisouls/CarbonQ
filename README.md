# CarbonQ - Carbon Footprint Tracker for AI Usage

CarbonQ is a browser extension that tracks the carbon footprint of your AI and LLM (Large Language Model) usage. Every time you send a prompt to an AI chatbot, it consumes energy and produces carbon emissions. CarbonQ helps you see and understand that impact.

## What It Does

CarbonQ runs quietly in the background of your browser. When you use AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity, CarbonQ automatically detects each query and estimates the CO2 emissions associated with it. It then presents your data in a clean, easy-to-read dashboard so you can see how your AI usage adds up over time.

## How It Works

1. **Install the extension** in your Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.).
2. **Create an account** or log in through the extension popup.
3. **Use AI platforms as you normally would.** CarbonQ detects your queries automatically -- it does not read or store the content of your prompts.
4. **Click the extension icon** to see a quick summary of your total emissions and query count.
5. **Visit the dashboard** for detailed analytics including daily trends, platform breakdowns, eco-scoring, and comparisons to regular web search.

## Supported Platforms

- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Google Gemini
- Perplexity
- Google Search

## Your Privacy

CarbonQ does not collect, store, or transmit the content of your prompts. It only records which platform you used, the estimated carbon cost of the query, and a timestamp. No IP addresses or personal browsing data are collected.

## Dashboard

The full web dashboard is available at: [https://carbon-q.vercel.app](https://carbon-q.vercel.app)

The dashboard provides:

- Total CO2 emissions and query counts
- Daily emission and query trends over the past week
- Per-platform usage breakdown
- Weekly trend predictions
- An eco-score rating your average query impact
- A comparison showing potential savings if some LLM queries were replaced with regular web searches
